    "about": "This project is one of my first post-bootcamp adventures! Using MERN stack, I am currently building an ecommerce website using javascript, css, html, mongodb, react, express, node, etc. As challenging as it has been, I have learned a lot so far and can't wait to have a finished product. This website is intended for professional use as it is being designed for a colleague that wishes to utilize its functionality and be deployed to the internet. It has also been a tremendous opportunity to build upon my skill set and hopefully catch the eye of any employer who passes over my github/portfolio.",
